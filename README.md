# Tic Tac Toe Game with React.js

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React.js. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins by having three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw if there are no more empty spaces left.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid to make their moves.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects when a player has won and displays the winning combination.
- **Draw Detection**: If no player wins and the grid is filled, the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Option**: Players can reset the game board to start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend framework used for building the user interface and managing game state.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic styling with Tailwind CSS and structure for the game.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Programming language used for game logic and interactivity.

## Usage

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser or deploy the project to a web server. Then, take turns with another player clicking on the squares to make your moves. The game will automatically detect when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
